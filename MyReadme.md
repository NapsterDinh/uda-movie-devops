### Create AWS infrastructure with Terraform

1. Export your AWS credentials from the Cloud Gateway
2. Use the commands below to run the Terraform and type `yes` after reviewing the expected changes

```bash
cd setup/terraform
terraform apply
```

4. Take note of the Terraform outputs. You'll need these later as you work on the project. You can always retrieve these values later with this command

```bash
cd setup/terraform
terraform output
```

### Generate AWS access keys for Github Actions

1. Once everything is created, you'll need to generate AWS credentials for the IAM user account that Github Actions will use in order to interact with your AWS account.
2. Launch the Cloud Gateway and go to the IAM service.
3. Under users, you should only see the `github-action-user` user account
4. Click the account and go to `Security Credentials`
5. Under `Access keys`  select `Create access key`
6. Select `Application running outside AWS` and click `Next`, then `Create access key` to finish creating the keys
7. On the last page, make sure to copy/paste these keys for storing in Github Secrets

### Add Github Action user to Kubernetes

Now that the cluster and all AWS resources have been created, you'll need to add the `github-action-user` IAM user ARN to the Kubernetes configuration that will allow that user to execute `kubectl` commands against the cluster.

1. Run the `init.sh` helper script in the `setup` folder

```bash
cd setup
./init.sh
```

2. The script will download a tool, add the IAM user ARN to the authentication configuration, indicate a `Done` status, then it'll remove the tool

### Setup Github Secrets
